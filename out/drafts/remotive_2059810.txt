Subject: Span.app Frontend Engineer - GenAI Alignment Opportunity

Hi Team,

I was really impressed with Span’s mission to streamline software engineering with AI-powered context – a direct alignment with our agency’s focus on GenAI agent development and RAG solutions.  This Frontend Engineer role at Span presents a fantastic opportunity to contribute to a product tackling a core challenge in the GenAI space.

Given our agency's expertise in building agents and leveraging LLMs, we believe your team's work is highly relevant.  Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to discuss how we can potentially collaborate on similar projects?  Best regards,
[Your Name/Agency Name]
